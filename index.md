# Vanilla OS
Taste the GNOME Vanilla experience on Ubuntu with some spicy.

## FAQ
Answers to the most frequently asked questions (despite the project is very young).
- **Why a new Distribution?**\
  Vanilla OS arose out of the need for an Ubuntu-based Linux distribution that would provide the GNOME Vanilla experience without any changes to the user experience. Later its scope was extended to experiment with some tools and technologies such as Almost (on-demand immutability) and Apx (the Distrobox-based subsystem).
- **Does it uses OSTree?**\
  No. Vanilla OS uses `almost` for the immutability part. We writted this tool to perform an On-Demand Immutability based on the immutability attribute of files. This approach works on any partition schema/file system. OSTree may still be considered in the future.
- **Rolling Release?**\
  No. Vanilla OS is a point release and follows the Ubuntu release cycle.
